This algorithm uses dynamic programming to find the maximum subarray sum within a 2-D matrix. It follows these key steps:

1-Initialization: The first column of a dynamic programming matrix is initialized with the values from the first column of the input matrix, as the maximum subarray sum ending at position (i, 1) is simply the value of matrix[i][1].

2-Iterative Calculation: The algorithm iterates through the columns from left to right, and for each column, it iterates through the rows from top to bottom. It calculates the maximum subarray sum ending at position (i, j) by considering the maximum sum from the previous column (j-1) and the current element matrix[i][j]. The result is stored in the dynamic programming matrix.

3-Finding the Global Solution: After completing the dynamic programming matrix, the algorithm identifies the global solution by selecting the maximum value from the last column of the matrix. This value represents the maximum subarray sum in the 2-D matrix.

By following these steps, the algorithm efficiently determines the maximum subarray sum in the given 2-D matrix.
