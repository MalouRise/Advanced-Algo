For this algorithm I first initialize 2 variables to represent the maximum sum and the submatrix we want at the end (initially empty)

Then I use loops and a temporary sum that run through the matrix 
I tracked the start and the end of te submatrix

Finally I print the result sum and the corresponding submatrix

For this algorithm the time complexity is O(n^3) but I think it is optimizable.
